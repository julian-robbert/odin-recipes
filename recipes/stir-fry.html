            <li>
                In a large pan on medium-high heat, add 1 tablespoon of oil. 
                Once the oil is hot, add chicken, season with salt and pepper, 
                and sauté until cooked through and browned. Remove cooked chicken 
                from pan and set aside.
            </li>

            <li>
                In the same pan, heat 1 tablespoon of oil and add mushrooms. 
                When the mushrooms start to soften, add broccoli florets and 
                stir-fry until the broccoli is tender. Remove cooked mushrooms 
                and broccoli from the pan and set aside.
            </li>

                until fragrant. Add the remaining sauce ingredients and stir until smooth.
